A copy trading bot on Solana automatically tracks and mimics the trades of a specific trader's wallet. It monitors the trader's transactions (like buying or selling tokens) and automatically executes the same actions in your wallet in real-time. The bot allows you to follow experienced traders without manually managing trades, copying their buys and sells on the Solana blockchain.

This bot offers comprehensive integration with all decentralized exchanges (DEXs) across the Solana ecosystem. This universal compatibility ensures maximum flexibility and optimal trading opportunities for our users.

### Added Good UI for your trading
- Can start and stop the bot easily from the frontend
- Can set all settings with Good UI
- Monitoring the wallet balance change and also the PnL from the char and statistical analysis


### Supported Trading Infrastructure:

- Full integration with major Solana-based DEXs including Raydium, Orca, Jupiter Aggregator, and other prominent exchanges

### Performance Analysis: Copy Trading Bot Response Time Evaluation
Our copy trading bot has undergone comprehensive performance testing using both standard RPC and gRPC protocols. Based on our benchmarking results, we found that while our bot performs adequately, its response times are notably slower compared to industry-standard trading systems that utilize optimized RPC and gRPC services.
For professional trading operations that require ultra-low latency, we recommend implementing performance enhancements to match the speed of high-performance trading infrastructure. Specifically, our tests indicate that a well-optimized RPC/gRPC implementation could significantly reduce latency and improve execution times for copy trading operations.
Key observations:

1. Current response times are higher than desired for real-time trading
2. There's measurable performance gap compared to optimized RPC/gRPC services
3. Potential for significant speed improvements through optimization
